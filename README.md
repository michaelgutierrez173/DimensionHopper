# DimensionHopper
I developed a game for my game design final project using Python and the pygame library. The player plays as a ufo which tries to avoid asteroids long enough for the black hole to spawn. The player must then reach the black hole to hop to the next dimension (level). Dimensions get progressively harder. Python was not a part of this classâ€™s coursework so I had to teach it to myself. It was my first ever Python project.

To play open download the pygame library.

Commented out pieces of code in the rock class which should be swapped to enabled for ai mode to work properly
